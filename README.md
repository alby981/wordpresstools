## Some wordpress tools. 

* insertPost.php is a simple script runnable from the web that can insert post related to parent pages. 
You need to specify the parent IDs and can get title from a single txt file or array. 

* insertYoutubeVideo.php is a simple script runnable only from CLI that insert a WP post with a Youtube iframe containing the video content that you need to post. Is nothing really fancy, you need to set the array of the videoID with the title and that's it. Needs to be improved since i made it in 10 mins. 

* loginWordpress.php is a nice script to login into Wordpress through Curl and do some actions on pages automatically. You can define an array and use it to login into different websites at the same time.
